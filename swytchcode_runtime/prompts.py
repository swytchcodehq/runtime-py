"""Tool-use guidance for models - see TOOL_USE_INSTRUCTIONS."""

# Models can be conservative about side-effecting actions (e.g. starring a repo,
# sending a payment) when a system prompt doesn't explicitly grant permission to
# act - they describe what they would do instead of calling the tool. Concatenate
# this into your system prompt / instructions to fix that.
#
# Scoped deliberately to only the tools this library provides: a combined system
# prompt often carries instructions for other, unrelated tools too, and a vaguer
# "call tools directly" instruction could be read as applying to those as well.
TOOL_USE_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "The tools below are provided by Swytchcode and represent real actions on connected "
    "services (e.g. starring a repo, creating an issue, sending a payment). When the "
    "user's request describes one of these actions, call the matching tool directly and "
    "let it run - do not just describe what you would do, ask for confirmation first, or "
    "wait for clarification if the request is already unambiguous. This guidance applies "
    "only to the Swytchcode tools provided here - it does not affect how you use any "
    "other tools available to you."
